Named Data Network Function Scenarios
====================================

This is the repo for running Named Data Network Function( NDNF) Scenarios using ndnSIM.




Prerequisites
=============
1. Core dependencies

    python >= 3.5

    libsqlite3

    pkg-config

    openssl

    Boost libraries >= 1.54


The following is to install the compiler, all necessary development tools and libraries, and ndn-cxx prerequisites for Ubuntu Linux 18.04.

    sudo apt install build-essential libsqlite3-dev libboost-all-dev libssl-dev git python-setuptools castxml
 


2. Dependencies for NS-3 Python bindings

To run visualizer module, you need to install additional dependencies.

   
    sudo apt install python-dev python-pygraphviz python-kiwi python-gnome2 ipython libcairo2-dev python3-gi libgirepository1.0-dev python-gi python-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-goocanvas-2.0 python-pip
    sudo pip install pygraphviz pycairo PyGObject pygccxml





Install ndnSIM
==============

To install NS-3 and ndnSIM, please refer to http://ndnsim.net.



Simulate NDNF Scenarios 
===================================


You can download the application files in  `apps` and the NDNF test scenarios in `examples` listed above, and then place the files in the `apps` and `examples` folder in the following directories: /ndnSIM/ns-3/src/ndnSIM/apps; /ndnSIM/ns-3/src/ndnSIM/examples.


To run End-System NDNF scenario, you can use the following command:

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-singleconsumer

To run Edge-Router NDNF scenario, you can use the following command: 

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-edgerouter

To run Any-Router NDNF scenario, you can use the following command: 

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-anyrouter
    
To run End-System NDNF scenario with multiple concurrent requests, you can use the following command:   

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-multiconsumer

To run End-System NDNF scenario with multiple NFV nodes, you can use the following command:   

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-multinfv

To run the simulation scenarios with the logging module of NS-3 enabled: 

    NS_LOG=ndn.Producer:ndn.Consumer ./waf --run=<scenario_name>

To run the simulation scenarios with visualizer:

    ./waf --run=<scenario_name> --vis
