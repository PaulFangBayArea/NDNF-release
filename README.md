Named Data Network Function Scenarios
====================================

This is the repo for running Named Data Network Function( NDNF) Scenarios using ndnSIM.


Feel free to contact pfang@umass.edu if you have any questions.

Prerequisites
=============
1. Core dependencies

    python >= 3.5

    libsqlite3

    pkg-config

    openssl

    Boost libraries >= 1.54


Following are the detailed steps for macOS to install the compiler, all necessary development tools and libraries, and ndn-cxx prerequisites.

    brew install boost pkg-config openssl libxml2

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig"  


2. Dependencies for NS-3 Python bindings

If you are planning to use NS-3 python bindings, a number of additional dependencies should be installed. For example, in order to run visualizer module, the       following should be installed:

    brew install cairo goocanvas gtk+3 graphviz gobject-introspection castxml

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"  

    pip install pygraphviz pycairo PyGObject pygccxml




Install ndnSIM
==============

To install NS-3 and ndnSIM, please refer to http://ndnsim.net website.



Simulate NDNF Scenarios 
===================================


You can download the application files in  `apps` and the NDNF test scenarios in `examples`.


To run End-System NDNF scenario, you can use the following command:

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-singleconsumer

To run Edge-Router NDNF scenario, you can use the following command: 

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-edgerouter

To run Any-Router NDNF scenario, you can use the following command: 

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-anyrouter

To run End-System NDNF scenario with multiple NFV nodes, you can use the following command:   

    ./waf --run=ndn-test-multinfv

To run the simulation scenarios with the logging module of NS-3 enabled: 

    NS_LOG=ndn.Producer:ndn.Consumer ./waf --run=<scenario_name>

To run the simulation scenarios with visualizer:

    ./waf --run=<scenario_name> --vis
